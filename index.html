				<h3>Biography</h3>
				
				<img src="https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_1:1%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTgwMjc0NTcwNjIyNjc0Nzk2/gettyimages-1185847058.jpg" id="hp">
				<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947, near Graz, Austria. He rose to fame as the world's top bodybuilder, launching a career that would make him a giant 
					Hollywood star via films like Conan the Barbarian, The Terminator and Total Recall. After years of blockbuster movie roles, Schwarzenegger went into politics, becoming 
					governor of California in 2003. He returned to the big screen after leaving office in 2011, finding success with The Expendables franchise and a return to the Terminator series.</p>

				<b>Early Years</b>		
				<p>Schwarzenegger's childhood was far from ideal. His father, Gustav, was an alcoholic police chief and one-time member of the Nazi Party, who clearly favored Arnold's 
					brother over his gangly, seemingly less athletic younger son. Gustav is reported to have beaten and intimidated Schwarzenegger and, when he could, pitted his two boys 
					against one another. He also ridiculed Schwarzenegger's early dreams of becoming a bodybuilder. "It was a very uptight feeling at home," Schwarzenegger later recalled.
					So uptight and uncomfortable, in fact, that Schwarzenegger would later refuse to attend the funeral of his father, who died in 1972, or his brother, who was killed in a 
					car crash in 1971.</p>

				<b>Bodybuilding Champion</b>
				<p>As an escape, Schwarzenegger turned to the movies, in particular those of Reg Park, a bodybuilder and star in B-level Hercules movies. The films also helped propel Schwarzenegger's 
					own obsession with America, and the future he felt awaited him there. Getting to his new country was the issue. Schwarzenegger found his answer in Joe Weider, the man behind the 
					International Federation of Body Building, an organization that sponsored contests such Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia. Weider loved Schwarzenegger's bravado, sense of humor, and the 
					potential he saw in the young bodybuilder. Weider's instincts couldn't have been more dead-on. In all, Schwarzenegger would win an unprecedented four Mr. Universe titles and seven
					Mr. Olympia crowns during his bodybuilding career. Equally significant, Schwarzenegger, who had immigrated to the United States in 1968, helped propel the sport into the mainstream, 
					culminating in the 1977 documentary, Pumping Iron, which tells the tale of Schwarzenegger's defense of his Mr. Olympia crown.</p>

				<b>Governor of California</b>
				<p>In 2003, Schwarzenegger again showed his resolve to succeed when he threw his hat into the ring for the California governor's race and won a seat in a special election. 
					In a state that was mired in severe budget woes, the newly elected Republican governor promised to bring economic stability to his adopted state. As expected, Schwarzenegger 
					brought his own unique brand of confidence to his new job. "If they don't have the guts, I call them 'girlie-men,'" he said of Democrats, early in his first term. "They should
					go back to the table and fix the budget." Still, as governor, Schwarzenegger worked to improve the state's financial situation, promote new businesses and protect the environment.
					In 2006, he easily won his bid for re-election. Throughout his political career, Schwarzenegger credited former U.S. President Ronald Reagan as a personal inspiration. Remembering
					his early years in the United States, Schwarzenegger once said, "I became a citizen of the United States when [Reagan] was president, and he is the first president I voted for as 
					an American citizen. He inspired me and made me even prouder to be a new American." His second term in office did not run as smoothly, however, as Schwarzenegger struggled to help 
					the state through difficult financial times. After leaving office in January 2011, he sought to revive his career in the entertainment industry. In March of that year, Schwarzenegger
					announced plans to work with famed comic book creator Stan Lee on a new animated series inspired by his time in office.</p>

				<b>His attitude toward Israel</b>
				<p>Schwarzenegger is known for his sympathy for the State of Israel. On July 23, 2006, during the Second Lebanon War, Schwarzenegger participated in a pro-Israel demonstration in 
					California against Hezbollah. Similar demonstrations followed Operation Cast Lead and the flotilla to Gaza in June 2010.</p>
